### A Full Stack Developer specializing in Backend Architecture & DevOps.

I leverage my expertise in **NestJS, PostgreSQL, and Docker** to build high-performance, scalable systems. My passion lies in architecting end-to-end solutions‚Äîfrom a clean, maintainable backend to a seamless deployment pipeline on the cloud. I am currently seeking a challenging role where I can contribute to creating robust software and grow within a talented engineering team.

### üí° My Engineering Philosophy

* **Architecture First:** I believe that a well-designed architecture is the foundation of any great application. I build projects with scalability, maintainability, and security in mind from day one.
* **Clean Code Advocate:** I follow principles like SOLID and write code that is self-documenting, easy to test, and a pleasure for other developers to work with.
* **DevOps Mindset:** I don't just write code; I think about how it will be deployed, monitored, and scaled. I embrace automation and containerization to create reliable and reproducible systems.
* **End-to-End Ownership:** I enjoy taking ownership of features from conception and technical design through to deployment and beyond.
